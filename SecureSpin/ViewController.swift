    Hi student in probobly Fall 2020, welcome to SecureSpin! This was my first time coding in Swift, XCode, or even a cellphone app,
 so sorry if the code isn't very good. I tried to leave some decent comments in case this is your first time using Swift as well, but
 idk how helpful I've been. I wrote a blog about this app for CS475,
 https://lindseyaherman.blogspot.com/2019/10/ajourney-of-thousand-miles-begins-with.html , where I liked to many of the websites
 where I learned how to code in Swift 5. If you're still confused, my John Carroll email is lherman21@jcu.edu , or if that gets deleted
 when I graduate, there's always lindseyherman95@yahoo.com. Feel free to shoot me an email about what code does.
 */


/*
    If you haven't done so already, go the the Main.storyboard and marvel at the click-and-drag graphics that make up the app.
 No Rectangle2D.Double code needed here! There are some confusing things in the actual code in the other classes though,
 such as the encryption and the many ways the screen changes each time a color is entered on the CreateLogin and WheelScreen.
 Also note that everything below the Assets.xcassets was auto-generated when the app was created, and I didn't change them.
 You probobly won't need to either. By the way, the Assets.xcassets stores all the images used in the app.
 Right now, the app is only using one image of a color wheel, but I kept the older color wheel images in case Dr. Gurary
 wants them one day for whatever reason.
